# Classification-of-Twitter-Account-into-bots-or-humans

## Introduction

This project was developed as part of the ***Final Year Major Project*** during my **Bachelors in Computer Engineering** at ***University of Mumbai***.

## Problem Statement

Goal of the project was to built a model based on twitter accounts details which could classify them into bots and humans. This was a Supervised Classification problem and we trained the model using machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor.

## Dataset and Research Methods

The Dataset was divided into Training Dataset(70%) and Testing Dataset(30%). The Training dataset had about 2800 values and the model was trained using supervised classification techniques, where it was labelled as 1 for bots and 0 for humans. This model was then tested on the testing dataset which had about 1200 values and we using various algorithms to compare the performance and choose the best.

Detailed analysis, approach, implementation and results can be found in the [Python File](./BotDetection.py)

Also find the [Project Report](./ProjectReport.pdf)

## Observation Results and Conclusion

We compared the accuracy of all the models used and we reported the highest testing accuracy of Random Forest Algorithm which was 88.45%. The accuracy rate was really good and this model can be implemented for other social media platforms as well.
